Project Name: About Me

  I'm learning how to code, and this is the second in a seriese of projects I will complete on my journey into coding.In this project you'll learn a little about me and i will be able to show you my Padawan-esque (that should be read "beginner") js, css, and html skills. Here I will prompt and alert you in a quiz...A quiz about me (whom you've never met). But no worries there's only five questions (oh and you'll get immediate feedback, either a doughnut will appear, or Terry Tate will jump through the screen....no, no probably not, but you will hopefully know that I am learning (slowly but surely)).

## Links and Resources
 - submission PR (don't know what this should link to, as this _is_ the repo to the Lab for which I submitted a link) 
 - Other Links I used for reference...If I could add the book we're using here I would, I'm enjoying it 

## Reflections and Comments
 - Well it's been completed, _it_ is going very well, the material is sticking in, and really, really enjoyable. As I said above, the choice of textbooks is very good, as they are my main reference and very readable. Not only am I enjoying studying the material, it's hard to get me away. 
 - My observations thus far...Well i start work around 0530-0600 in the morning, don't really take lunch, and usually work until about 1930-2000 at night, well up until this course at least. With that beign said, getting caught up on the reading was the difficult part (due to the amount of reading needing to be completed). 
 - Well I'm still not done, but expect to be able to re-submit by late tomorrow evening. Definitely took longer than I expected, but I cahlk that up to me going down _*ALL*_ the rabbit holes when it comes to css, and js. I look forward to the rest fo the courses especially if it stays like this. 
 Fun.
